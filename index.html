    <p>Anakin Skywalker was a Force-sensitive human male who served the Galactic
      Republic as a Jedi Knight, and later the Galactic Empire as the
      Sith Lord Darth Vader. Believed to have been conceived by the Force,
      he was born to Shmi Skywalker into a life of slavery on the Outer Rim
      world of Tatooine. At a young age, Skywalker was discovered by the Jedi Order,
      who freed Anakin from slavery and brought the boy into their community;
      hailing Skywalker as the Chosen One of Jedi prophecy, destined to defeat
      the Sith and bring balance to the Force.</p>
